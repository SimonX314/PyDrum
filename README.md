# PyDrum
This Repo contains all files, bibliography and code regarding the our final project for the undergrad course "Numerical Methods for Engineers". The main idea of the project is a program written in Python that solves a numerical 2D problem, this being a simulation of the drum head of a Bass Drum, modeled as a circular membrane.
